## Introduction
#### Customer Behavior Analysis is the process of examining how customers interact with a product, service, or platform to understand their actions, preferences, and decision-making processes.This report presents a detailed analysis of the E-Commerce dataset, covering demographic insights, purchase behavior, and specific analyses such as conversion rates and churn rates.
## Overview
#### This E-Commerce Data Analysis project aims to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns within e-commerce platform. By analyzing demographic information, purchase behavior, I seek to uncover trends that can inform strategic decision-making and enhance the overall customer experience. Below are the processes I follow for this task.
## Data collection/Cleaning
#### For this analysis I used the dataset available on statso.To address data inconsistencies, missing values, and to ensure the dataâ€™s quality and accuracy I used Excel.
## Libraries Used
#### Pandas
#### Matplotlib.pyplot
#### Seaborn
#### Numpy
## Loading and Exploring the Dataset
#### Summary of Numeric Data-Provide an overview of key statistics for numeric columns in the dataset.
#### Summary of Non-Numeric Data-Summarize key information about non-numeric columns, including unique values and data types.
## Demographic Analysis
#### Gender Distribution-Visualize the distribution of customers based on gender using barplot.
#### Age Distribution -Explore and present insights into the age distribution of customers using histogram. This is important to identify the age groups that are most active or contribute significantly to purchases.
## Purchase Behavior Analysis
#### Location-wise Purchases-Analyze purchases made based on customer locations using barplot. Insights into demographic and behavior analysis can inform targeted marketing campaigns, improving the efficiency of marketing budgets by identifying regions with a high concentration of purchases and explored whether location correlates with purchasing behavior.
## Device Usage Analysis
#### Examine the distribution of device types used by customers using barplot.To check if there are patterns related to device preferences and behavior.
## Behavior Analysis
#### Present insights into customer behavior, including average product browsing time, total pages viewed, and items added to cart using scatterplot.Understanding product browsing time, total pages viewed, and items added to the cart can contribute to enhancing the overall user experience on the platform.
## Gender-based Analysis
#### Explored and compared average purchases made by different genders using barplot.
## Conversion Rate Analysis
#### Calculated and discussed conversion rates based on the number of items added to the cart.
## Churn Rate Analysis
#### Explored and calculated churn rates based on the provided dataset.Understanding churn rates can be crucial for developing strategies to retain customers and improve long-term customer loyalty.
## Conclusion
#### This analysis has shed light on crucial aspects of e-commerce business. Demographic insights have provided a deeper understanding of customer base, enabling targeted marketing strategies. Purchase behavior analysis has uncovered trends that can enhance product recommendations and optimize the user experience. The calculation of conversion and churn rates equips with actionable metrics to refine sales funnel and retain customers. By leveraging these insights, we can make informed decisions to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the competitive e-commerce landscape.
